## Objective
Football is one of the most popular sports in the United States, but given the inherent possibility of head injury for athletes, people have become more concerned about safety, including the potential implications for cognitive symptoms following a concussion. How does public interest in concussion change over time and what factors might explain these changes? Understanding these trends would be useful for medical professionals, as contextual (i.e., psychosocial) factors can impact a patient's report of problems following a head injury. Identifying and clarifying these issues may assist healthcare professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of concussion.

## Project Description
Mild traumatic brain injury, also known as concussion, has garnered significant interest over the years, especially due to concerns about sports-related head injury in children and adults. Heightened public awareness of head injury often results in an increase in patient-initiated personal research on the clinical disorder. It is reasonable to consider the possibility that this might be associated with an increase in patients' report of concussion-related symptoms during medical visits. The aim of this study was to track what factors might be associated with concussion-related internet searches. This information could be useful to medical providers as this can moderate their approach to assessing or treating concussion by considering different elements of the broader picture (e.g., problems which are most concerning to patients, what areas of the country might be more likely to report symptoms, media-associated factors that could affect patients' interest in such symptoms, etc.).
