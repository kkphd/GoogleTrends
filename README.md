##  Tracking Public Interest in Sports-related Concussion using Google Trends

Mild traumatic brain injury, also known as concussion, has garnered significant interest over the years, especially
due to concerns about sports-related head injury in children and adults. Heightened public awareness of head injury
often results in an increase in patient-initiated personal research on the clinical disorder. It is reasonable to 
consider the possibility that this might be associated with an increase in patients' report of concussion-related 
symptoms during medical visits. The aim of this study was to track what factors might be associated with concussion-
 related internet searches. This information could be useful to medical providers as this can moderate their approach
  to assessing or treating concussion based on different factors (e.g., problems which are most concerning to patients,
what areas of the country might be more likely to report symptoms, media-associated factors that could affect 
patients' interest in such symptoms, etc.).
